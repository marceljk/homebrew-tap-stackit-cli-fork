# STACKIT IDP Migration

> [!WARNING]
> Starting on July 9 2024, the new [STACKIT Identity Provider (IDP)](https://docs.stackit.cloud/stackit/en/release-notes-23101442.html#ReleaseNotes-2024-06-21-identity-provider) will be available.
>
> On this date, we will release a new version of the STACKIT CLI that will use the new IDP for user authentication. This also means that the **user authentication on STACKIT CLI versions released before July 9 2024 is no longer guaranteed to work for all services**.
>
> Please make sure to **update your STACKIT CLI to the latest version after July 9 2024** to ensure that you can continue to use all STACKIT services.
